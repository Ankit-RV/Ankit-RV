- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ankit Raghuvanshi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Analysis
- ðŸŒ± An aspiring data analyst based in Mumbai. With a background in mechanical engineering and a certification in data analytics from Masai School, I'm skilled in Python, SQL, and Tableau, and have experience in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

As an experienced data analyst, I have a passion for collecting and modeling large datasets to improve business operational productivity. I'm proficient in data cleaning and preprocessing, and have expertise in data visualization tools like Excel and Tableau. My strong problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and adaptability have allowed me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to identify and solve data-related issues.

In my previous roles, I've worked on a variety of data analysis projects including conducting a data analysis of Airbnb host behavior across multiple cities using SQL, Excel and Tableau. I've also built machine learning models to estimate the compressive strength of concrete using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn.

In addition to my data analysis experience, I also have a background in mechanical engineering. As a mechanical engineer, I've worked on managing operations and maintenance of CFBC Boiler and Turbine, demonstrating strong technical and problem-solving skills.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and volunteering for charitable causes such as Nadias Initiative. I'm currently seeking a challenging role in a data-driven organization that values creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.
